  <img alt="React + TypeScript + Webpack" src="./.github/images/react-typescript-webpack.png" width="900px"/><br/>
  <p>A React project template configured for TypeScript development and bundled with Webpack.</p>

  [React](https://reactjs.org/) | [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) | [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
</div>

## 🙋🏽 Why?

While [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) is a great way to jump start a simple project, it unfortunately abstracts away most of the configuration. This makes it difficult to understand React project configuration for quick customization or required packages for dependency management.

## 🧱 How?

This React template was created from scratch using the bare minimum package dependencies needed to run a React + TypeScript project that is bundled with Webpack and tested with Jest.

Review the [commit history](https://github.com/cloud-city-crafted/react-typescript-webpack-template/commits/main) to see which files were created/edited for each step of the configuration process.
