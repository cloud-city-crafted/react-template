  <p>A React project template configured for TypeScript development and bundled with Webpack.</p>

  [React](https://reactjs.org/) | [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) | [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
</div>

## üôãüèΩ Why?

While [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) is a great way to jump start a simple project, it unfortunately abstracts away most of the configuration. This makes it difficult to understand React project configuration for quick customization or required packages for dependency management.

## üß± How?

This React template was created from scratch using the bare minimum package dependencies needed to run a React + TypeScript project that is bundled with Webpack and tested with Jest.

Review the [commit history](https://github.com/cloud-city-crafted/react-typescript-webpack-template/commits/main) to see which files were created/edited for each step of the configuration process.

1. [Initialize Project](https://github.com/cloud-city-crafted/react-typescript-webpack-template/pull/1)
2. [Setup TypeScript](https://github.com/cloud-city-crafted/react-typescript-webpack-template/pull/2)
3. [Setup React](https://github.com/cloud-city-crafted/react-typescript-webpack-template/pull/3)
4. Setup Jest
5. Setup Webpack

## ‚öõÔ∏è What?

This project template only uses the dependencies and configurations needed to:

- Create a React Web Application
- Develop React Components using TypeScript (using `.tsx` files)

The final state is a React app equivalent to the starting point of [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/).
